## Introduction and background 
This document is aimed to guide players through the mechanics and multiple storylines of the HER game. 

HER is a player-choice-based game that puts the story's outcome into the playerâ€™s hands. We developed and designed this game with the intent of allowing players to feel in control and to have multiple opportunities to play the game with different outcomes based on the choices that they make.

The game is inspired by hidden object games such as the Agatha Christie game series and choice-based games/series such as the game House and the Netflix series Bandersnatch.  

The style of the game is inspired by games that use pixel art such as Undertale and Mario. It also has some influence from television shows such as Gravity falls and Courage the Cowardly Dog.

This game is aimed at those who enjoy mystery and thriller-based games/stories and those who enjoy narrative gameplay. 

Due to the nature of this game, please be aware of the following content that some may be sensitive to:

- Blood 
- Violence 
- Substance abuse
- Injury and Death

Our team, The Femme Fatales, is passionate about our game and we appreciate all feedback and positive criticism as it will only improve our understanding and user experience for players.
